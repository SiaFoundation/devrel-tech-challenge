As a developer evangelist, you are tasked with writing a short tutorial on setting up renterd and creating a utility that can migrate files from an AWS bucket to renterd, as well as outlining a distribution strategy for the tutorial.

## Tutorial Topics 
1. Setting up renterd: explain how to install and set up renterd on a local machine or a remote server. You should cover the following topics:
	+ Building or downloading renterd
	+ Generating a wallet seed
	+ Starting renterd
	+ Configuring autopilot and forming contracts
2. Creating a utility in any programming language to migrate files from an AWS bucket: explain how to create a utility that can migrate files from an AWS bucket to renterd. You should cover the following topics:
	+ Installing the AWS SDK
	+ Setting up AWS credentials
	+ Listing files in an AWS bucket
	+ Migrating files from the AWS bucket to renterd

Your tutorial should be in Markdown format and include code snippets, screenshots, and clear instructions. You can assume that the reader has some basic knowledge of programming and AWS, but you should not assume that they have any prior knowledge of Sia or renterd.

## Distribution Strategy

Describe how you would go about reaching the target audience with your tutorial. Some possibilities to consider include:
+ Publishing a blog post on Medium or another platform
+ Syndicating the content across multiple channels
+ Turning the written text into multimedia content (e.g., videos, infographics)
+ Engaging with developer communities on social media, forums, or chat platforms
+ Feel free to propose any creative ideas for maximizing reach and impact

For the distribution strategy, provide a brief explanation of your proposed approach, along with any relevant examples or resources. Consider the most effective ways to engage and educate your target audience, promote the Sia platform, and demonstrate your understanding of the developer community and the channels they frequent.
