As a developer evangelist, you are tasked with writing a short tutorial on building a utility that can migrate files from an AWS bucket to `renterd` and outlining a distribution strategy for the tutorial.

### Tutorial Topics
- Provide a short introduction on Sia and `renterd`. You should cover the following:  
	- What is Sia?
	- What is decentralized storage?
	- What is `renterd`?
- Building a utility in any programming language to migrate files from an AWS bucket: explain how to build a utility that can copy files from an AWS bucket to renterd. You should cover the following topics:
	- Installing the AWS SDK
	- Setting up AWS credentials
	- Listing files in an AWS bucket
	- Migrating files from the AWS bucket to renterd

Your tutorial should be in Markdown format and include code snippets and clear instructions. You can assume that the reader has some basic knowledge of programming and AWS, but you should not assume that they have any prior knowledge of Sia or renterd.

### Distribution Strategy
Describe how you would go about reaching the target audience with your tutorial. Some possibilities to consider include:
- Publishing a blog post on Medium or another platform
- Syndicating the content across multiple channels
- Turning the written text into multimedia content (e.g., videos, infographics)
- Engaging with developer communities on social media, forums, or chat platforms
- Feel free to propose any creative ideas for maximizing reach and impact

For the distribution strategy, briefly explain your proposed approach, along with any relevant examples or resources. Consider the most effective ways to engage and educate your target audience, promote the Sia platform, and demonstrate your understanding of the developer community and the channels they frequent.

### Resources

- **Intro to Sia:** https://docs.sia.tech/get-started-with-sia/sia101
- **Intro to renting:** https://docs.sia.tech/renting/about-renting
- **Intro to `renterd`:** https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/wiki
- **API Documentation:** https://api.sia.tech/renterd#4978ac58-f401-49e3-8ec1-4d5d32ea5f72
- **`renterd` Go SDK:** https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/blob/master/worker/client.go

We have mocked the relevant `renterd` API endpoints for this task. You can download, upload, and list objects using the mock API instead of setting up a `renterd` node.
+ `[GET] https://renterd-mock.sia.tools/api/worker/objects/*key`: download an object
+ `[PUT] https://renterd-mock.sia.tools/api/worker/objects/*key`: upload a new object
+ `[DELETE] https://renterd-mock.sia.tools/api/worker/objects/*key`: delete an object

Each endpoint uses HTTP basic auth. An auth token can be generated by sending a `POST` request to `https://renterd-mock.sia.tools/api/test/register`
```sh
curl https://renterd-mock.sia.tools/api/test/register -X POST
```

Requests can then be made per the API documentation or with the `renterd` SDK.
```sh
curl -u :10eaea417c1dcbea6bec6382ec9547ea https://renterd-mock.sia.tools/api/worker/objects/foo/bar.jpg
```
### Submission

To submit your task, create a new GitHub repo and email the link to your interviewer. If you have any questions or issues, join the Sia discord https://discord.gg/sia and message Nate or Steve.
